# Notes for NVIDIA RTX 4090 (Ada, SM 8.9)

- Requires CUDA Toolkit 11.8 or newer (12.x recommended) and a recent NVIDIA driver that supports Ada GPUs.
- Build with GPU support and set compute capability to 89, for example:

```
$ make gpu=1 ccap=89 all
```

- Autodetect: `make` now tries to autodetect your highest GPU compute capability; with an RTX 4090 it should pick 89 automatically.
- On Windows, use the VC_CUDA118 project or newer and ensure Code Generation includes `compute_89,sm_89`.

## Build

Build and enjoy.\
\
Note: The current release has been compiled with Visual studio 2019 and CUDA SDK 10.2, if you have a different release of the CUDA SDK, you may need to update CUDA SDK paths in Kangaroo.vcxproj using a text editor. The current nvcc option are set up to architecture starting at 3.0 capability, for older hardware, add the desired compute capabilities to the list in GPUEngine.cu properties, CUDA C/C++, Device, Code Generation.

Visual Sutido 2017 + Cuda 10 => Take project files in VC_CUDA10 (project files might be out of date)\
Visual Studio 2019 + Cuda10.2 => Take project files in VC_CUDA102\

## Linux

Install CUDA SDK.\
Depending on the CUDA SDK version and on your Linux distribution you may need to install an older g++ (just for the CUDA SDK).\
Edit the makefile and set up the good CUDA SDK path and appropriate compiler for nvcc.

```
CUDA       = /usr/local/cuda-8.0
CXXCUDA    = /usr/bin/g++-4.8
```

You can enter a list of architecture (refer to nvcc documentation) if you have several GPU with different architecture. Compute capability 2.0 (Fermi) is deprecated for recent CUDA SDK.
Kangaroo need to be compiled and linked with a recent gcc (>=7). The current release has been compiled with gcc 7.3.0.\
Go to the Kangaroo directory. ccap is the desired compute capability.

```
$ g++ -v
gcc version 7.3.0 (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04)
$ make all (for build without CUDA support)
or
$ make gpu=1 ccap=20 all
```

# Note on Time/Memory tradeoff of the DP method

The distinguished point (DP) method is an efficient method for storing random walks and detect collision between them. Instead of storing all points of all kangagroo's random walks, we store only points that have an x value starting with dpBit zero bits. When 2 kangaroos collide, they will then follow the same path because their jumps are a function of their x values. The collision will be then detected when the 2 kangaroos reach a distinguished point.\
This has a drawback when you have a lot of kangaroos and looking for collision in a small range as the overhead is in the order of nbKangaroo.2<sup>dpBit</sup> until a collision is detected. If dpBit is too small a large number of point will enter in the central table, will decrease performance and quickly fill the RAM.
**Powerfull GPUs with large number of cores won't be very efficient on small range, you can try to decrease the grid size in order to have less kangaroos but the GPU performance may not be optimal.**
Yau can change manualy the DP mask size using the -d option, take in consideration that it will require more operations to complete. See table below:

| nbKangaroo.2<sup>dpBit</sup>/sqrt(N) |  DP Overhead | Avg | 
|--------------------------------------|:------------:|:---:|
| 4.000 | cubicroot(1+4.000) = ~71.0% | 3.55 sqrt(N) |
| 2.000 | cubicroot(1+2.000) = ~44.2% | 2.99 sqrt(N) |
| 1.000 | cubicroot(1+1.000) = ~26.0% | 2.62 sqrt(N) |
| 0.500 | cubicroot(1+0.500) = ~14.5% | 2.38 sqrt(N) |
| 0.250 | cubicroot(1+0.250) = ~7.7% | 2.24 sqrt(N) |
| 0.125 | cubicroot(1+0.125) = ~4.0% | 2.16 sqrt(N) |

DP overhead according to the range size (N), DP mask size (dpBit) and number of kangaroos running in paralell (nbKangaroo).

# Probability of success

The picture below show the probability of success after a certain number of group operations. N is range size.
This plot does not take into consideration the DP overhead.

![Probability of success](DOC/successprob.jpg)


# How it works

The program uses 2 herds of kangaroos, a tame herd and a wild herd. When 2 kangoroos (a wild one and a tame one) collide, the 
key can be solved. Due to the birthday paradox, a collision happens (in average) after 2.08*sqrt(k2-k1) [1] group operations, the 2 herds have the same size. To detect collision, the distinguished points method is used with a hashtable.

Here is a brief description of the algorithm:

We have to solve P = k.G, P is the public key, we know that k lies in the range [k1,k2], G is the SecpK1 generator point.\
Group operations are additions on the elliptic curve, scalar operations are done modulo the order of the curve.

n = floor(log2(sqrt(k2-k1)))+1

* Create a jump point table jP = [G,2G,4G,8G,...,2<sup>n-1</sup>.G]
* Create a jump distance table jD = [1,2,4,8,....,2<sup>n-1</sup>]
 
for all i in herdSize</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tame<sub>i</sub> = rand(0..(k2-k1)) <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tamePos<sub>i</sub> = (k1+tame<sub>i</sub>).G <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wild<sub>i</sub> = rand(0..(k2-k1)) - (k2-k1)/2 <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wildPos<sub>i</sub> = P + wild<sub>i</sub>.G <em># Group operation</em></br>

found = false</br>

while not found</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for all i in herdSize</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  tamePos<sub>i</sub> = tamePos<sub>i</sub> + jP[tamePos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  tame<sub>i</sub> += jD[tamePos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  wildPos<sub>i</sub> = wildPos<sub>i</sub> + jP[wildPos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Group operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  wild<sub>i</sub> += jD[wildPos<sub>i</sub>.x % n] <em># Scalar operation</em></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if tamePos<sub>i</sub> is distinguished</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  add (TAME,tamePos<sub>i</sub>,tame<sub>i</sub>) to hashTable</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  if wildPos<sub>i</sub> is distinguished</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  add (WILD,wildPos<sub>i</sub>,wild<sub>i</sub>) to hashTable</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;found = is there a collision in hashTable between a tame and a wild kangaroo ?</br>
</br>

(Tame,Wild) = Collision</br>
k = k1 + Tame.dist - Wild.dist</br>


Here is an illustration of what's happening. When 2 paths collide they form a shape similar to the lambda letter. This is why this method is also called lambda method.

# Compilation

Compilation Commands:
```
make gpu=1    Compile with GPU support.

make cpu=1    Compile optimized for CPUs.

make debug=1  Compile with debug symbols for debugging.
```

Main Target: Compiles the final executable kangaroo-256.

Dependency Management: Ensures that necessary directories ($(OBJDIR), $(OBJDIR)/SECPK1, $(OBJDIR)/GPU) are created before compiling.

Cleaning: Removes all object files and other generated files (cuda_version.txt, deviceQuery/cuda_build_log.txt) when make clean is invoked.

This Makefile structure allows you to easily switch between different compilation configurations (amd, gpu, default) by setting appropriate flags when invoking make, or by modifying the Makefile directly. Adjust paths (CUDA, CXXCUDA), compiler flags (CXXFLAGS, LFLAGS), and dependencies (SRC, OBJET) as per your project's requirements.

## Windows

Install CUDA SDK 10.2 and open VC_CUDA102\Kangaroo.sln in Visual C++ 2019.\
You may need to reset your *Windows SDK version* in project properties.\
In Build->Configuration Manager, select the *Release* configuration.\
Build and enjoy.\
\
Note: The current release has been compiled with Visual studio 2019 and CUDA SDK 10.2, if you have a different release of the CUDA SDK, you may need to update CUDA SDK paths in Kangaroo.vcxproj using a text editor. The current nvcc option are set up to architecture starting at 3.0 capability, for older hardware, add the desired compute capabilities to the list in GPUEngine.cu properties, CUDA C/C++, Device, Code Generation.

## Linux

Install CUDA SDK.\
Depending on the CUDA SDK version and on your Linux distribution you may need to install an older g++ (just for the CUDA SDK).\
Edit the makefile and set up the good CUDA SDK path and appropriate compiler for nvcc.
